    \brief The \ref recover action is used to change the active- and owner-authorities for specified account.

    \param account account for which new keys should be applied
    \param active_key specifies new value for the key in active-authority (optional parameter)
    \param owner_key specifies new value for the key in owner-authority (optional parameter)

    This action recovers both the active- and owner-authorities. Active key recovery is performed immediately.

    To change the owner key, a user should make a request using the \ref recover action with non-empty \a owner_key parameter. This request will be saved in the \ref commun::structures::owner_request table and can be executed using \ref applyowner action with a delay specified by the \a recover_delay parameter. This request can be canceled by the \ref cancelowner action at any time.

    When a user makes two requests to recover the owner key, the last request cancels the previous one.

    \note
    At least one of the two parameters either \a active_key or \a owner_key must not be empty.

    This function can be applied only to those accounts that allow the contract to recovery keys. To do this, the account should allow the contract to satisfy the owner’s authority by adding <i>c.recover@cyber.code</i> actor.

    The contract sets active-authority as follows:
    
    \code{.json}
    {
        "threshold": 1,
        "keys": [{"key": active_key, "weight": 1}],
        "accounts": [],
        "waits": []
    }
    \endcode

    and owner-authority as follows:
    
    \code{.json}
    {
        "threshold": 1,
        "keys": [{"key": owner_key, "weight": 1}],
        "accounts": [{"permission": {"actor": "c.recover", "permission": "cyber@code"}, "weight": 1}],
        "waits": []
    }
    \endcode
